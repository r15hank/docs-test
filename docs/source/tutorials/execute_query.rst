Executing query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now that you've created a draft query, in order to preview search results:

1. Ensure you've added the query text manually or through querybuilder.
2. Set a meaningful name to this query in the name textbox.
3. Populate date range if necessary and select the checkbox if populated.
4. Click on :guilabel:`+` button to add databases to your query, this will show you a dropdown containing the list of databases that are supported.

to run your search across each query.

for this particular query against that particular database.

8. You can also see the combined results by clicking on the :guilabel:`Show All` button,
this could also contain duplicate results, because some research papers could be common across different databases based on the query.
