Curating query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After you have completed designing and setting up your queries in your project,
you can begin curating the search results based on the categories that you've configured for this project.

In order to begin curation:

1. Select any query from your project dashboard and upon selecting you shall find the blue :guilabel:`CURATE` button.

2. Click on it and it will open the curation page on another tab. On this page you will find all the unique results
associated with your query from different sources (API-based as well as Manual) that have been stored on this system.
This provides you a breakdown of results from different sources and provides you option
to search results based on title name or filter them based on sources or categories.

    :format: html

3. Each result has a dropdown that provides additional details about the research paper and if you click on the :raw-html:`<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6"></path><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><line x1="10" y1="14" x2="21" y2="3"></line></svg>` button
besides the title, then it will open the research paper from the source website on a new tab.
