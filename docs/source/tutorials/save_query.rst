Saving query
^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point, you were successfully able to draft a query, build your query text, fetch results from datasource and manually patch results if necessary.
Upon reviewing all the results you can now save this query.

1. To save a query simply click on the red :guilabel:`SAVE` button.

.. note::
   While saving query, we get rid of duplicate results based on the title. Hence we get rid of the redundant results and only store the unique records.
   Few titles have `.` added to the end, so consider all results that have similar title text ignoring the `.`, hence we're able to only unique records into our system

.. note:: You cannot modify the attributes or results of the query once you save it. So ensure you've completed drafting your query at this point

3. Upon saving this query, we now this query is no longer in draft state and there's an option to see only unique results at the bottom right of the card.
By clicking this it will show the results that we filtered in and saved into this system.

5. You can clone a duplicate query to draft by clicking on the :raw-html:`<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="clone-icon" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M 9 4 C 6.800781 4 5 5.800781 5 8 C 5 9.113281 5.476563 10.117188 6.21875 10.84375 C 4.886719 11.746094 4 13.28125 4 15 L 4 20.625 L 6 21.625 L 6 28 L 12 28 L 12 21.625 L 14 20.625 L 14 19 L 12 19 L 12 19.375 L 10 20.375 L 10 26 L 8 26 L 8 20.375 L 6 19.375 L 6 15 C 6 13.332031 7.332031 12 9 12 C 10.667969 12 12 13.332031 12 15 L 14 15 C 14 13.28125 13.113281 11.746094 11.78125 10.84375 C 12.523438 10.117188 13 9.113281 13 8 C 13 5.800781 11.199219 4 9 4 Z M 23 4 C 20.800781 4 19 5.800781 19 8 C 19 9.113281 19.476563 10.117188 20.21875 10.84375 C 18.886719 11.746094 18 13.28125 18 15 L 18 20.625 L 20 21.625 L 20 28 L 26 28 L 26 21.625 L 28 20.625 L 28 15 C 28 13.28125 27.113281 11.746094 25.78125 10.84375 C 26.523438 10.117188 27 9.113281 27 8 C 27 5.800781 25.199219 4 23 4 Z M 9 6 C 10.117188 6 11 6.882813 11 8 C 11 9.117188 10.117188 10 9 10 C 7.882813 10 7 9.117188 7 8 C 7 6.882813 7.882813 6 9 6 Z M 23 6 C 24.117188 6 25 6.882813 25 8 C 25 9.117188 24.117188 10 23 10 C 21.882813 10 21 9.117188 21 8 C 21 6.882813 21.882813 6 23 6 Z M 23 12 C 24.667969 12 26 13.332031 26 15 L 26 19.375 L 24 20.375 L 24 26 L 22 26 L 22 20.375 L 20 19.375 L 20 15 C 20 13.332031 21.332031 12 23 12 Z M 15 14.1875 L 15 16 L 11 16 L 11 18 L 15 18 L 15 19.8125 L 17.8125 17 Z"></path></svg>` button.
This will basically create a new query and copy all the parameters used in previous query such as query name, search text, date range, etc.

6. Change the query name and other parameters as necessary and with these steps you can create as many queries in your project, as required.
