It's time to configure the categories that you would like to maintain for categorizing
the search results associated with the queries of this project.
To configure click on the :raw-html:`<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="color: var(--primary-color); cursor: pointer; font-size: 1.5rem;"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="3"></circle><path d="M19.4 15a1.65 1.65 0 0 0 .33 1.82l.06.06a2 2 0 0 1 0 2.83 2 2 0 0 1-2.83 0l-.06-.06a1.65 1.65 0 0 0-1.82-.33 1.65 1.65 0 0 0-1 1.51V21a2 2 0 0 1-2 2 2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-.09A1.65 1.65 0 0 0 9 19.4a1.65 1.65 0 0 0-1.82.33l-.06.06a2 2 0 0 1-2.83 0 2 2 0 0 1 0-2.83l.06-.06a1.65 1.65 0 0 0 .33-1.82 1.65 1.65 0 0 0-1.51-1H3a2 2 0 0 1-2-2 2 2 0 0 1 2-2h.09A1.65 1.65 0 0 0 4.6 9a1.65 1.65 0 0 0-.33-1.82l-.06-.06a2 2 0 0 1 0-2.83 2 2 0 0 1 2.83 0l.06.06a1.65 1.65 0 0 0 1.82.33H9a1.65 1.65 0 0 0 1-1.51V3a2 2 0 0 1 2-2 2 2 0 0 1 2 2v.09a1.65 1.65 0 0 0 1 1.51 1.65 1.65 0 0 0 1.82-.33l.06-.06a2 2 0 0 1 2.83 0 2 2 0 0 1 0 2.83l-.06.06a1.65 1.65 0 0 0-.33 1.82V9a1.65 1.65 0 0 0 1.51 1H21a2 2 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 1-2 2h-.09a1.65 1.65 0 0 0-1.51 1z"></path></svg>`
icon to open project settings.

This would open a popup for the project settings where you can update project name/description, delete project and setup categories.
Click on the blue :guilabel:`ADD` button to add a category and you can add as many categories you would like for your project.

.. note::

   The first category that you create will be the default category that will be assigned to all the search results initially upon fetching.
   Ensure that you design in this in an meaningful manner.

We will setup few categories as shown below as part of this tutorial.
We can set specific colors and label to each category.

Upon creating them we need to individually save them by clicking on the :guilabel:`SAVE` button.
Once the categories are saved, close the project category dialog box.
This will enable the query panel, thus allowing us with the next steps to design and execute queries.
